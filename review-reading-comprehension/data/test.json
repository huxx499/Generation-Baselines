You can fix this problem by using an external mouse.\n\nI recently made a couple of home movies with iLife and they were a huge success!", "qas": [{"answers": [], "question": "how is the laptop ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-laptop"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the screen ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-screen"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the keyboard ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-keyboard"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the processor ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-processor"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the build quality ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-quality"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the look ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-look"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the battery life ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-battery"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the price ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-price"}, {"answers": [], "question": "is it heavy ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-heavy"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the speed ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-speed"}, {"answers": [], "question": "is it easy to use ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-use"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the design ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-design"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the os ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-os"}, {"answers": [], "question": "does it have a camera ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-camera"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the running temperature ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-runningtemp"}, {"answers": [], "question": "how is the size ?", "id": "B000GABVOS-AUDO7OH82G1SR-size"}]}, {"context": "Thinking about 2006 I would put this laptop as the best purchase I made; even beating some classics as the Kitchen Aid mixer.
